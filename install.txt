CAR API README problem for Ally

Node and mongo need to be installed. 

Run npm install

Run node seeder.js to seed Mongo.

Run make test to run chai tests.

Run node server.js to make queries against it.

HAVE FUN!!!!

Thoughts on this project. I decided to use Node because it is less overhead for simple API end points.

I am relying heavily on the performance of Mongo and the NPM geolib. If performance was an issue these
would be the bottlenecks. I did not see a performance issue in the seed data I had but I don't know
about scaling.
